						<h1>(2.1) Classified Statement of Financial Position</h1>
						<p>There are four main sections</p>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Assets</b></li>
							<li><b>Liabilities</b></li>
							<li><b>Shareholders Equity</b></li>
							<li><b>Comprehensive Illustration</b></li>
						</ul>

						<h3>Heirarchy of Assets</h3>
									<b><p>Current Assets:</p></b>
									<ul>
										<li>Cash: includes both cash on hand and cash deposited in the banks or other financial instituions</li>
										<li>Trading Investments: Investments in debt securities such as bonds of another company, or equity securities such as shares of another company, or equity securities such as shares of another company.</li>
										<li>Accounts Recievable:Amounts owed to a company by its customers who purchased products or services on credit (on account)</li>
										<li>notes Recievable:Amounts owed to a company by its customers or others supported by a written promise to repay</li>
										<li>Inventory: Goods held for sale to customers</li>
										<li>Supplies</li>
										<li>Pre-Paid Insurance and expenses: represent the cost of expenses like rent and insurance paid in advance of use. They are current assets because they reflect unused benefits such as office space and insurance coverage available for future use.</li>
									</ul>
									<b><p>Non-Current Assets</p></b>
									<p>Long-Term Investments</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Multi-year investments in debt securities that management intends to hold to earn interest</li>
										<li>Equity Securities of other companies that management plans to hold for many years to generate investment income for strategic reasons.</li>
									</ul>
									<p><b>Property, Plant and Equipment:</b> Tangible assets with relatively long useful lives that companies use when operating a business. This category includes items such as land, buildings, equipment, furniture and vehicles.</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Property</li>
										<li>Land</li>
										<li>Business</li>
										<li>Vehicles</li>
										<li>Accumulated Depreciation</li>
									</ul>
									<b><p>Intangible Assets:</p></b>
									<ul>
										<li>Patents</li>
										<li>Copyrights</li>
										<li>Trademarks</li>
									</ul>
									<p><b>Goodwill:</b> An asset that results from the aquisition of another company when the price paid to aquire the company is higher than the fair value of the purchased company's net identifiable assets</p>
									<i>Goodwill is similar to intangible assets in that it has no physical substance and will generate future benefits. However, unlike intangible assets that a company can sell seperately from other assets, acompanyt cannot sell goodwill by itself. Goodwill is an excess value related to the entire company.</i>
						
							<h3>Heirarchy of Liabilities</h3>
									<b><p>Current Liabilities</p></b>
									<ul>
										<li>Bank Indebtedness:a short-term loan from a bank, typically occurring when a company uses an operating line of credit to cover cash shortfalls.</li>
										<li>Accounts Payable:represent amounts owed by the company to suppliers for purchases made on credit (account) and are usually recorded when an invoice is received.</li>
										<li>Deferred Revenue:represents cash received from a customer before performing a service or providing goods to that customer.</li>
										<li>Notes Payable: Promises in writing to pay amounts owed, often to banks but also to suppliers or others.</li>
										<li>Current portion of long-term debt: portion of debt due within the year</li>
									</ul>
									<b><p>Current Liabilitites</p></b>
									<ul>
										<li>Notes Payable: Some notes payable can be due for beyond a year</li>
										<li>Lease Liabiliites: Include amounts that a company will pay in the future on long-term rental contracts used for equipment or other property.</li>
										<li>Pension and Benefit Obligations: Amounts companies owe past and current employees for retirement benefits.</li>
										<li>Deferred Liabilities: Liabilities</li>
									</ul>

							<h3>Shareholders Equity</h3>
							<i>There are two components</i>
							<ul>
								<li><b>Share Capital:<b> Purchases shares in a company by investing cash (or other assets). when the comapny recieves thes3e assets, it issues ownershipcertificates to these investors in the form of common or preferred shares. if a company issues preferred shares in addition to common shares, it will classify or title the totla of all classes of shares issued as share capital</li>
								<li><b>Retained Earnings:</b>Represents the cumulitive amounts of net income that a company has retained.</li>			
							</ul>

						<h1>(2.2) Identifying Ratios Relative to the companies liquidity, solvency and profitability</h1>
						<p><b>We can analyse a companies liquidity, solvency and profitability using ratio analysis</b></p>
						<p>Data Analytics: The Process of analysing enourmous amounts of data to find patterns and correlations, trends and other valuable insights to enhance descision-making. This includes descisions that will impact financial reporting.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Using the statement of financial position</li>
							<li>Using Statement of income</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>3 types of Ratios</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Intracompany Comparisons: Covering two or more periods for the same company.</li>
							<li>Intercompany Comparisons: Based on comparisons with a competitor in the same industry.</li>
							<li>Industry Comparisons: Based on comparisons to average ratios for the industry that a company operates in.</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Liquidity</h3>
						<p>A companies ability to pay its obligations that are due for payment within the next year. You would use liquidity ratios to look closely at the relationship of its current assets to its current liabilities.</p>
						<p><b>Working Capital:</b> Difference between Current Assets and Current Liabilities</p>
						<i>Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities</i>
						<p><b>Current Ratio:</b> a ratio between the current assets to liabilities</p>
						<i>Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities</i>
						<h3>Solvency</h3>
						<p>Measure a company’s ability to survive over the long term by having enough assets to settle its liabilities as they fall due.</p>
						<p><b>Debts to Total Assets:</b> measure a company’s ability to survive over the long term by having enough assets to settle its liabilities as they fall due.</p>
						<i>Debt to Total Assets = Total Liabilities / Total Assets</i>
						<h3>Profitability</h3>
						<p>Measure a company’s operating success over time in specific periods, usually one year.</p>
						<p><b>Basic earnings Per Share (EPS):</b> Measures the income earned on each common share</p>
						<i>Basic earnings Per Share = Income Available to Common Shareholders / Weighted Average Number of Common Shares</i>
						<p><b>Price earnings Ratio:</b> The price-earnings ratio is a frequently quoted statistic that is the ratio of the common share price in the stock market to its basic earnings per share.</p>
						<i>Price Earnings Ratio = Market Price Per Share / Basic earnings Per Share</i>

						<h1>(2.3) Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Fianancial Statements</h1>
						<p><b>The Objective of Financial Reporting</b> is to provide finacial informaion to existing and potential investors, lenders, and other users that will be usefull in descision-making. Those descisions can include buying or selling the companies shares or lending to and collecting loans from the company.</p>
						<p>Financial statements are prepared using the <b>accrual basis of accounting</b> Under this basis of accounting, a company will record the effects of transactions in the period they occur and not when the company receives or pays cash</p>
